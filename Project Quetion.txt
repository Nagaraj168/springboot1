->Develop a java program to store integer objects as the key which indicates student_id and student objects as the value inside LinkedHashMap.
->Every student object with have 3 attributes called as id, name and marks.
->Get all the values(student object) from the LinkedHashMap and store inside ArrayList.
->Based on the input or choice from the user sort based on id or name or marks. 

Note:
	1) Achieve upcasting.
	2) Use put() for Map and add method for List.
	3) Use Comparator for sorting.
	4) Use Collections.sort()
	5) In Student Class the data members are private therefore use constructor for setting the data and have 3 respective getter().





2nd Project:

1. Collection Project-2
2. jspiders
3. MainClass.java
-------------------
1. public ->Employee
2. privatre ->name and salary
3. public ->constructor
4. 2 public getter()
5. toString() ->Salary of tom is 2.5
--------------------------
1. create 3 emp instances.
2. upcasting ->Map and LinkedHashMap ->put(K,V)
3. keys -> employee names and values -> employee Objects
----------------------------------------------------------
1. Convert Map into a set of Keys.
2. upcasting ->List and ArrayList ->add()
3. get all the values(mployee objects) from Map and Store it inside ArrayList.
4. Traverse the Objects from ArrayList

3rd Project(Imp)

1. Project ->SDBMS
2. package ->com.jspiders
3. Class ->Solution.java ->main()
--------------------------------
Interface ->StudentManagementSystem
1. Add Student
2. displatStudent
3. displayAllStudent
4. removeStudent
5. removeAllStudent
6. updateStudent
7. countStudent
8. sortStudent
--------------
Implementation Class -> StudentManagementSystemImpl
2. IS-A ->implements
3. Contract of Abstract ->Override
------------------------------------
public class-> Student
private attribute -> id, age,name and marks.
public constructor -> age, name and marks, id->generate automatically
public 3 setter methods and 4 getters method
public toString()
--------------------------------
Collection ->Database ->Map & LinkedHashMap ->key(String) ->value(Student)
